Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering for Machine Learning (Housing Dataset)

This project focuses on preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning tasks using a housing dataset. The goal is to prepare the data for predictive modeling by applying various preprocessing techniques and creating new features to enhance model performance.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the housing dataset to ensure data quality.
Feature Scaling: Scale numerical features to a similar range to prevent dominance of certain features during model training.
Categorical Encoding: Encode categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones or extract meaningful information to improve model accuracy.
